 "Character Recognition using Neural Networks."

Abstract:

The Ultimate Goal of this paper is to produce a `Text-to-ASCII' translator implemented in software. The software is to scan printed text and produce ASCII output using Neural Network techniques. At the time this paper was commenced, no neural network packages were available, so the time-consuming task of producing one was undertaken. The result was the emergence of some general tools for understanding and testing neuro-modelling concepts. The tools provide a testbed where the Text-to-ASCII translation can be seen to function. In combination with the tools, this paper also serves as a training ground for future research. I have supplied some novel ideas for applications that I believe will inspire further studies in the exciting field of neuro-computing. Wherever possible, analogies are drawn to electrical engineering in an attempt to improve comprehensibility by evoking concepts familiar to electrical engineers.
